UI BASICS

UX, User experience .
• The full experience from user’s first contact to last
• Facilitate the best feeling a user receives while operating on device

ID, Interaction Design.
• Interaction of the user and the system
• Goal oriented and the way users will interact, user needs, limitations a context

UI, User interface , 
Visual touch points that allow user to interact with a product -> Graphics

 UX is basically a subset of product design
• Product design is business oriented
– Consistently successful product
– Branding and marketing
– Identifying market opportunity

wireframe:
(General features and content of an user interface without graphical details.)
Evaluating logic
No graphic detail, easier to focus on the UI logic and navigation
Can be static or interactive
UI skeleton is basically a wireframe in mobile design.
When wireframe is ready, the UI designer starts interface design
Not technical limitations

prototypes:
(Final model of the product that are able to simulate real interactions.)
• Final model of the product
• Visual and functional elements, buttons and field
• Stakeholders , designers and users can test the prototype
• Simulating real interactions

mockups:
(Design that consist of colors, logos, pictures etc. that shows how the product will look but do not contain any real interactions.)
More detailed design
Colors, logos, pictures
May contain demo content instead of ”real” final content
Shows how the product will look
Level of detail
Static vs clickable
Single or multipage
SW tools like Adobe XD, Pencil, Sketch, Figma, Axure etc.

UI design principles
– Visibility
– Consistency
– Learnability
– Predictability
– Feedback

Visibility
• Choose what to show  avoid visual information fatigue
• Show only what is really needed . User should not use time to search
what he needs
• User should quickly see how and where to achieve goal
• UI components , colors , size , layout, logical order

Consistency
• How user makes sense of the UI
• Consistency is achieved by using similar patterns for
– Color
– Typography
– Element location
– Function location
– Process steps
• Keep things simple!

Learnability
• UI usage should be easy to learn for the user
– Novice vs technical expert
• Familiarities
– Common design conventions and layouts (logout in right upper
corner)
– Commonly used terminology (like login, register)
– Direction of flow (e.g. ok is left, cancel is right)
• Feedback
• Help and tooltips


Predictability
(That applications or devices actions are predictable to user.)
• What action I should take to reach the goal?
• Using familiar widgets and group of widgets
• Familiar processes
– Like buying a product using shopping chart and familiar payment
steps.
• Predictability and learnability have similarities
• User could e.g. see the steps of process before executing them
• Some actions should be predicted
–E.g. closing document should always confirm that the document is
saved.

Feedback
• Where am I now?
• What is the next step?
• What is the current status?
• What happened?
• E.g. Confirmation that the process was successful
• Error feedback and how to fix it
